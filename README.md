# Final undergraduate project

This is a project during which I have studied the feasibility of using image classification CNNs as feature extractors for image segmentation.<br>
We have focused on medical imaging, specifically liver lesion segmentation, using the LiTS19 dataset. <br>
The individual models use parts of well known CNNs and follow the design of Google's DeepLabV3 architecture for segmentation.<br>
The models have been trained on a multi-GPU cluster, so running the training procedures locally might be difficult given the size of the dataset.<br>

### Further documentation
 - For the results and general aspects of the architecture, here is the published paper: [Paper link](https://doi.org/10.3390/bioengineering9090467)
 - For a more detailed technical explanation, see the PDF file, it is the documentation for my final thesis project
 
Enjoy!
